#Jayhawk Schedule

This is a simple django app built to track the __Kansas Jayhawks 2013-14__ basketball schedule. It's a simple application rebuilt in django from the original [codeigniter project](https://github.com/jesseoverright/jayhawk-schedule/). The app allows a user to:

- create games, setting opponent, location, tv info
- subscribe to a ical calendar feed
- update results as games occur
